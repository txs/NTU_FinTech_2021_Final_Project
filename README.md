- [x] Git Instructions for Colab 2021-06-01 07:20:21

Since Colab doesn't support multiple ipynb for a single vm, I guess we have to use git on local machine and upload the ipynb to Colab each time for editing and download back to the project folder to replace the old file. Then, github commit and push to the remote.

We can use Google Drive feature from Colab. However, I'm not sure if running a git repo while syncing with Google Drive is a good idea for version control.
