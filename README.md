- [x] Git Instructions for Colab 2021-06-01 07:20:21

Since Colab doesn't support multiple ipynb for a single vm! I think we have to manage the git at the local machine and upload the ipynb each time for editting and download back to the project folder. Then, github commit and push to the remote!

You may use the Google Drive feature from Colab. However, I'm not sure if running a git repo is a good idea for syncing.
